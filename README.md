## Description

This here is the challenge number eleven from the bootcamp, which is the last one. 
For this challenge, I will utilize what you have learned in `Module 13: React` to develop the initial scaffolding of your portfolio sites as well as create and/or update other materials so that I can showcase your skills to potential employers. 

## Acceptance Criteria

* I must fullfil the requirements listed in the following sections:

### Design

Remember, "good" design is subjective. Your site should look "polished" and "professional". Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Mobile-first design

* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Make sure the font size is large enough to read and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

### Base Requirements

  * [ ] React
  * [ ] Navigation with `React Router`, dynamic rendering, or another third part router
